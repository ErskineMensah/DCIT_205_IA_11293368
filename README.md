# What I learnt from this project

In my opinion, working on this project has been educative, fun, stressful, time consuming and at times frustrating. The positives I picked from the completion of this project was exposure and development of my knowledge in html, css and javascript.

I had the opportunity to discover new tags in html such as the section, navigation, script, form and div tags. Some of which were crucial to the page layout.

For the css aspect, I studied some new ways oof styling and modifying html elements. One notable part of the application of css is the Display style which gives options such as: block, inline, inline-block, flex, grid, none and others which helped out in the positioning and layout of all the pages.

For the javascript aspect, I came across ways of creating personalized functions and implementing them using the script tag.

For the git and github aspects, the videos and resources aided in my understanding of some commands and functionalities of git and github.

For the responsive design aspect, I studied ways to create websites that provide optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. The goal was to ensure that the website looks and functions well on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. I made use of components such as media queries, flexible images and media, viewport meta tag, css flexbox and grid.

The main challenge I encounter while working on this project had to do with Structuring all elements on the website to appeal aesthetically to the user.  Using css to attain this design was really stressful and required intensive studies with practical applications.
