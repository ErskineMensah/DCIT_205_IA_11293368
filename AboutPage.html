                <h1>WeLcome To Department Of computer Science</h1>     
                <p>Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we are living in. Therefore, if society is to achieve quick economic advancements and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential.
                 The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers daily, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately, and morally are all included in computer science.
                 Employers who recruit computer scientists demand competent programmers with knowledge of modern techniques and tools as well as the ability to apply good engineering concepts to the conception, building, and maintenance of their systems. Computer programming is at the core of computer science. 
                 Sub-fields in Computer Science include, among others, Operating Systems, Computational Science, Programming Languages, Automata  Theory, Architecture, Intelligent Systems, Information Storage & Retrieval and Software Engineering. Our graduates are prepared for the computing industry by the variety of courses offered in the department and the skills they acquire.
                These courses enable students to work in a project team, research and development team, or other setting where they can contribute specialized skills.</p>
